# PGVIEW: Implementation Strategies for Views over Property Graphs

 * This repository includes the codes and datasets for PGVIEW. Paper Link: [TBD].

## Installation 

 * We outline the installation process specifically for Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS. However, with minor adjustments, it can also be applied to macOS.
 * For detailed installation instructions, please refer to [this page](docs/install.md).

## Quick Start
 * This outlines how to start PGVIEW and create views and query over the views.

 * Clone this repository.

 * Use Maven to compile the source code.
 > mvn compile

 * Set up the configuration file ```conf/graphview.conf``` by making a copy of ```conf/graphview.conf.sample```.

### Start PGVIEW
